These are the Doom development files released in December 2014 and
April 2015 by John Romero.

Each directory corresponds to one of the .zip files:

* **DOOMART1993**: Assorted collection of artwork, unused sprites, photos
  and sketches from Doom's development, that were posted on Twitter by
  John Romero on Doom's 21st birthday.

* **possessed**: Doom zombie sprites that include a full set of rotations
  for all angles. Some angles were not included in the released IWADs as
  sprite mirroring was used to save space. Released two days later
  (December 12th).

* **doomguy-all-rotations**: Doom player sprites, again with a full set of
  rotations.

* **DoomEd**: source code to the original DoomEd editor used by id software
  to make Doom's levels. Released April 22nd 2015.

* **doom-maps**: the .DWD format sources to the Doom and Doom II levels,
  along with the source code to the id BSP builder and *doomprint* tool
  used to create the maps for the Doom hint book.

* **doom-textures**: various textures and other graphics from Doom's
  development, many of which were cut from the game. These are in .LBM
  format. **doom-textures-png** is a conversion of all graphics files
  from this directory to PNG format that can be viewed in a browser.
